{"name":"Virtual Museum","tagline":"Document physical artefacts as a community","body":"#Why\r\n\r\nI'm looking after the keys to a room of stuff from the very early days of computing. This collection of stuff is never going to make it into a museum setting. It really needs to be photographed and described. Knowledge of these artefacts is individually remembered, and a means is needed to gather together descriptions of the artefacts.\r\n\r\n#What\r\n\r\nVirtual Museum is basically a wiki that is to be used to catalogue and describe related artefacts in a collection. Collection item descriptions can be developed by users, and comments can be used to add related information. Contributors who don't feel like curating wiki content may prefer to use comments to add information to item descriptions, and later these comments might be gathered and incorporated into the wiki content by people who enjoy curating page content.\r\n\r\n#Facilities\r\n\r\n~~Strikethrough is used to indicate features still to be implemented~~\r\n\r\nContributors must have registered themselves as users, ~~there is a class of admin users who can perform a few some privileged operations~~.\r\n\r\nPages ~~and their comments~~ support rich content: Text, hyperlinks to other pages, images, YouTube and Vimeo video. \r\n\r\nAs each page describes a museum artefact, each is ~~identified with a catalogue or accession number~~.\r\n\r\n#Status\r\n\r\nIn development, with features as above.\r\n\r\n#Licence\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
