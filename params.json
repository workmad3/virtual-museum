{"name":"Virtual Museum","tagline":"Document physical artefacts as a community","body":"#Why\r\n\r\nI've got the keys to a room of stuff from the early days of computing that is never going to make it into a museum setting. It really needs to be photographed and described. Knowledge of these artefacts is individually remembered, and a means is needed to gather descriptions of the artefact.\r\n\r\n#What\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to develop a wiki, with comments visible on each page. Page content can be developed by users, comments can be used to add related information. Some people who don\\'t feel like curating wiki content may prefer to use comments to add information that can later be gathered and incorporated into the page.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this may be useful to others with community cataloguing and/or documentation needs\r\n\r\n\r\n#Content type\r\n\r\nPages can contain text, hyperlinks to other pages, images, YouTube and Vimeo video. Comments can contain the same.\r\n\r\n#Status\r\n\r\nIn development, user authentication with pages that may have content as above. Need to add comments, do a bit of tweaking and add an OS licence.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
