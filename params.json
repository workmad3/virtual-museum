{"name":"Virtual Museum","tagline":"Document physical artefacts as a community","body":"#Why\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation for Virtual Museum is that I'm looking after the keys to a room of stuff from the very early days of computing. For one reason or another, this collection is never going to make it into a museum setting. Further, the collection is not documented in any way, and the generation of people who know about the items in the collection is growing smaller and smaller. \r\n\r\nHowever, this group of people are computer literate and hopefully motivated to document artefacts given a suitable system to do so.\r\n\r\n#What\r\n\r\nVirtual Museum is basically a wiki that is to be used to catalogue and describe related artefacts in a collection. Collection item descriptions can be developed by users, and comments can be used to add related information. \r\n\r\nContributors who don't feel like curating wiki content may prefer to use comments to add information to item descriptions, and later these comments might be gathered and incorporated into the wiki content by people who enjoy curating page content.\r\n\r\nThus we can make adding knowledge into a lightweight operation, add some information or a recollection in a comment to a wiki page that contains an image of something in the collection -- no need to be a wiki page author or have a heavy commitment to the repository contents.\r\n\r\n#Features\r\n\r\nStrikethrough is used to indicate features still to be implemented:\r\n\r\n* A basic authorisation scheme:\r\n  * Contributors must have registered themselves as users.\r\n  * ~~Commenters may also authenticate with Facebook, Google, Twitter or Linked in~~.\r\n  * ~~Admin users can perform a few privileged operations~~.\r\n\r\n* Wiki pages, with the ability to add comments to them.\r\n\r\n* Wiki pages ~~and their comments~~ support rich content: \r\n  * Text.\r\n  * Hyperlinks to other pages, both created and still to be created.\r\n  * URLs to the outside world.\r\n  * Images.\r\n  * YouTube ~~and Vimeo~~ videos. \r\n\r\n* ~~Audio comments for those who don't feel like typing.~~\r\n\r\n* Wiki pages may also be formatted using [Markdown](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet), a simple text formatting language.\r\n\r\n* Page are identified and searchable via tags and categories, both of which may be easily added to pages.\r\n\r\n* The category scheme for pages based on a customisable Linked Data representation of hierarchies of categories.\r\n\r\n* ~~Page formats according to categories~~:\r\n\r\n  * For example, pages categorised as representing a museum artefact contain ~~a unique reference for and the current location of the artefact~~.\r\n  * Whereas pages categorised as representing a person have neither of these fields.\r\n\r\n* ~~RDF generation of collection data~~ for linked data aficionados.\r\n\r\n#Status\r\n\r\nIn development, with features as above, strike through indicates 'still to be implemented'\r\n\r\n#Licence\r\n\r\nA slightly modified MIT Open source licence appears in the source code.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
