<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h1>

<p>I'm looking after the keys to a room of stuff from the very early days of computing. This collection of stuff is never going to make it into a museum setting. It really needs to be photographed and described. Knowledge of these artefacts is individually remembered, and a means is needed to gather together descriptions of the artefacts.</p>

<h1>
<a name="what" class="anchor" href="#what"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What</h1>

<p>Virtual Museum is basically a wiki that is to be used to catalogue and describe related artefacts in a collection. Collection item descriptions can be developed by users, and comments can be used to add related information. </p>

<p>Contributors who don't feel like curating wiki content may prefer to use comments to add information to item descriptions, and later these comments might be gathered and incorporated into the wiki content by people who enjoy curating page content.</p>

<h1>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h1>

<p>Strikethrough is used to indicate features still to be implemented.</p>

<p>Contributors must have registered themselves as users, <del>there is a class of admin users who can perform a few some privileged operations</del>.</p>

<p>Pages <del>and their comments</del> support rich content: Text, hyperlinks to other pages, images, YouTube and Vimeo video. </p>

<p>As each page describes a museum artefact, each is <del>identified with a catalogue or accession number</del>.</p>

<h1>
<a name="status" class="anchor" href="#status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h1>

<p>In development, with features as above.</p>

<h1>
<a name="licence" class="anchor" href="#licence"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Licence</h1>

<p>Open source, as per licence in the source code.</p>
